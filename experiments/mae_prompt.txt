Create a complete, runnable MAE ViT self-supervised training repo in the current directory.

STRICT SCOPE (do not exceed):
- Create ONLY the files listed below.
- Do NOT add extra files, folders, or features.
- Do NOT add distributed training, mixed precision, wandb, or advanced optimizers.
- Keep the code concise but complete.

REQUIRED FILES (exact names):
- config.yaml
- model.py
- dataset.py
- train.py
- losses.py
- metrics.py
- utils.py
- README.md
- requirements.txt

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (must all be met):
- Pure PyTorch (no Lightning).
- MAE ViT encoder/decoder with patchify + masking.
- Train loop + eval loop.
- Checkpoint save/load.
- Seed + determinism.
- Config-driven: load config.yaml; allow CLI overrides.
- Dataset: include a synthetic dataset option (no external downloads).
- Logging: simple stdout logging per epoch.

OUTPUT RULES:
- Output only file contents (no explanations).
- Do not include code fences.
